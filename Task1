# Purpose:
#
# This program will get user's input for width and length of a rectangle, in centimeters.
# It will then calculate and illustrate the result for the area of rectangle in cm^2,
# and the perimeter of the rectangle in cm.

print("Enter the width of the rectangle (in cm):")  #using print to display prompt to the user
width = input()  #calling input() function to collect user's input
width = float(width)  #now we can work with numeric value

print("Enter the length of the rectangle (in cm):")  #using print to display prompt to the user
length = input()  #calling input() function to collect user's input
length = float(length)  #now we can work with numeric value

#Multiply the width to the length of rectangle when calculating area of rectangle
rectangleArea = (width * length)
#Multiply * 2 to the sum of the width and length of rectangle when calculating perimeter of rectangle
rectanglePerimeter = 2 * (width + length)

#using the variable with the input user provided in the code. 
print("The area of rectangle is " + str(rectangleArea) + " cm2.")
print("The perimeter of rectangle is " + str(rectanglePerimeter) + " cm.")
